# Combat

See [README.md](README.md) for how this doc relates to `SPEC.md` and the other
subsystem docs. See [character.md](character.md) for Player stats and
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for the `ITickable`/`IGameLoop` mechanism
this system hooks into.

**Superseded by [engine-vs-ruleset.md](engine-vs-ruleset.md)**: everything on
this page now lives in `SharpMud.Ruleset.Classic`, not `SharpMud.Engine` -
combat is ruleset-specific by design (see the findings doc's §9). `ICombatant`
becomes `CombatantBehavior`, attached to whichever `Thing`s the ruleset wants
to be able to fight; `Player`/`Npc` references below mean "a `Thing` with the
relevant behaviors."

## Model

Simple round-based combat (Diku/Circle-style), per SPEC.md: auto-attack on
the global tick, hit/miss/damage messages, minimal per-round input required
once engaged. **v1 scope is player-vs-NPC only** — no PvP verb or aggression
rules exist yet, so every encounter is keyed by the attacking player.

Implemented shape (`src/SharpMud.Engine/Combat/`) differs from the original
sketch in two ways: `ITickable.OnTick` is `Task OnTickAsync(...)`, not `void`
(it needs to `await` `ISession` writes each round — same reasoning as
`IWorld.MovePlayer` becoming `MovePlayerAsync`), and there's one
`CombatManager` registered with `IGameLoop`, not one `ITickable` per
encounter — it owns a `Dictionary<PlayerId, CombatEncounter>` and resolves
every active encounter each tick:

```csharp
public sealed class CombatEncounter
{
    public required Player Attacker { get; init; }
    public required Npc Defender { get; init; }
}

public interface ICombatManager
{
    bool IsInCombat(PlayerId playerId);
    void StartEncounter(Player attacker, Npc defender);
    void EndEncounter(PlayerId playerId);
    bool TryGetEncounter(PlayerId playerId, out CombatEncounter? encounter);
}

public sealed class CombatManager(IWorld world, ICombatResolver resolver, RoomId hubRoomId)
    : ICombatManager, ITickable
{
    public Task OnTickAsync(TickContext ctx, CancellationToken ct) { /* see below */ }
}
```

`ICombatant` also grew two members beyond the original sketch
(`CurrentHitPoints`/`ArmorClass`/`DamageRange` only) — `Name` and
`MaxHitPoints`, both needed for round messages and death/respawn handling
that the doc implied but didn't spell out as interface members:

```csharp
public interface ICombatant
{
    string Name { get; }
    int CurrentHitPoints { get; set; }
    int MaxHitPoints { get; }
    int ArmorClass { get; }
    (int Min, int Max) DamageRange { get; }
}
```

`Player` and `Npc` both implement `ICombatant`.

Hit/damage formula: Diku/Circle-style d20-vs-AC roll — attacker rolls d20 vs.
defender Armor Class to hit; damage is a random roll within the attacker's
`DamageRange`. **Currently implemented as an unmodified d20 roll** — no
level/skill to-hit bonus yet (see Open Items; the modifier-scaling formula
is still undecided, so the code has nothing to apply).

Formulas live in a dedicated `ICombatResolver` (pure, unit-testable, no I/O):

```csharp
public interface ICombatResolver
{
    CombatRoundResult ResolveRound(ICombatant attacker, ICombatant defender);
}

public sealed record CombatRoundResult(bool Hit, int Damage, bool DefenderDefeated);
```

`ResolveRound` both computes **and applies** the round (mutates
`defender.CurrentHitPoints` directly) — matching the original "resolve one
round: hit check → damage → apply → check death" description.

## Sequence: Combat Round Resolves

1. Player types `"kill cave rat"` → `AttackCommand` resolves the target NPC
   in the room (`ctx.CurrentRoom.Npcs` → `IWorld.GetNpc`, matched by
   case-insensitive substring), calls `ICombatManager.StartEncounter`, sends
   `"You attack cave rat!"` immediately (engagement is instant; resolution is
   tick-gated). If the player is already in combat, the command instead sends
   `"You are already fighting!"`.
2. On the next global tick, `IGameLoop` calls `CombatManager.OnTickAsync`,
   which iterates every active encounter.
3. `ICombatResolver.ResolveRound(attacker, defender)` computes the player's
   attack; a hit/miss message is sent immediately via the player's session.
4. If the NPC is defeated, see Death & Respawn below and the round ends there
   (no counter-attack).
5. Otherwise, **the NPC counter-attacks the same round** (classic mutual
   combat) via a second `ResolveRound(defender, attacker)` call; another
   hit/miss message is sent. If this defeats the player, see Death & Respawn.
6. Otherwise the encounter stays in the dictionary and resolves again next
   tick — repeats without further player input until death or `flee`
   (disconnect handling is a stub for now, see below).

## Disconnect Mid-Fight (stub)

The full design — `CombatState.Linkdead`, a grace period before the
encounter is force-abandoned, resuming on reconnect — is **not implemented**.
Currently, if `IWorld.GetSession(playerId)` returns `null` on a tick (no
session registered for that player), `CombatManager` just removes the
encounter immediately. This is an intentional stub, not a design change —
implementing the real grace-period behavior needs session
reconnect/resumption (see [networking.md](networking.md)), which doesn't
exist yet since there's only one local transport.

## Death & Respawn

Classic-stakes model, implemented in `CombatManager`:

- **NPC death**: attacker's `Player.Experience` increases by
  `Npc.ExperienceReward`, the NPC is removed from the world via
  `IWorld.RemoveNpc` (which also removes it from its room's occupant list —
  see [world-model.md](world-model.md)), the encounter ends. Loot drops are
  **not implemented** — the item system itself is a later build-order phase,
  so there's nothing to drop yet.
- **Player death**: `Player.Experience` is reduced by a flat **10%**
  (placeholder — exact percentage is still an open item), `CurrentHitPoints`
  is reset to `MaxHitPoints / 2` (placeholder — exact fraction is still an
  open item, minimum 1), `CurrentRoomId` is reset to the hub room, and the
  hub's description is sent via `LookCommand.SendRoomDescriptionAsync`. No
  item loss and no corpse-run.

## Flee

Implemented in `FleeCommand`. Requires an active encounter
(`ICombatManager.TryGetEncounter`) and at least one exit in the current room.
Success chance is currently a **flat 60%** via `IRandomSource.Next(1, 100)`
— the real DEX-differential formula from the original design is still an
open item, and `Npc`/`ICombatant` doesn't carry Dexterity, so there's nothing
to differential against yet. On success, a random exit is chosen
(`IRandomSource.Next` over `Room.Exits`), the encounter ends, and
`IWorld.MovePlayerAsync` runs exactly as a normal move (see
[commands.md](commands.md)).

## Open Items

- Exact to-hit modifier scaling (how level/skill translate into a d20 bonus)
  — not implemented at all yet (currently an unmodified roll).
- Real linkdead/reconnect handling — currently a stub that just ends the
  encounter; needs session resumption (see [networking.md](networking.md))
  to implement properly.
- Flee success-chance formula (exact DEX-differential-to-probability curve)
  — currently a flat 60%; would also need Dexterity added to `ICombatant` or
  a separate lookup.
- XP-loss percentage on player death — currently a flat 10% placeholder.
- Respawn HP fraction — currently `MaxHitPoints / 2` placeholder.
- Loot drops on NPC death — not implemented; blocked on the item system.
- Tick interval default value (see [architecture.md](architecture.md)) is
  still the 2-second default from `GameLoopOptions`; not yet tuned against
  the placeholder combat formulas above.
