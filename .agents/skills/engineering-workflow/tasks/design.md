# Task: Design

**Trigger:** asked to design a new feature, an architecture change, or
answer "how should I structure this" — including picking up the next item
off a roadmap (e.g. the next slice in `PLAN-0001`). Produces a decision
(an ADR, and usually a plan) that `tasks/implement.md` then builds against.
This task **does not write application code** — if you catch yourself
editing a `.cs` file mid-design, stop; that belongs in `tasks/implement.md`
once the ADR is `Accepted`.

## Load these references first

Always:
- `references/design-decisions.md` — this task is that file's process,
  turned into a checklist; read it in full, not just skimmed, since the
  light/deep-dive distinction and the ADR/plan mechanics are the actual
  content of this task
- `references/documentation.md`

Conditionally, based on what the design touches — load these *before*
generating alternatives, not after, since they constrain which
alternatives are even legal:
- `references/coding-standards.md` — the design will produce code; know
  the constraints (composition over inheritance, DI-only, no MEF/
  singletons) before proposing a shape that violates them
- `references/persistence.md` — touches `SharpMud.Persistence`, a new/
  changed `Behavior`, or anything that needs to survive a restart
- `references/security.md` — touches auth, secrets, config, or the Telnet
  input surface
- `references/testing.md` — the design has a non-obvious test strategy
  worth deciding up front (e.g. how something inherently timing-/
  concurrency-sensitive gets covered)

## Procedure

1. **Check for existing precedent before assuming this is new.** Grep for
   the likely type name (`Behavior`, `Manager`, `Command`) and skim the
   relevant `docs/*.md` — a request phrased as "add X" is often "X already
   exists, here's where" (`design-decisions.md`'s opening rule). A design
   session grounded in what's already there beats one that re-derives a
   solved problem.
2. **Decide light vs. deep**, per `design-decisions.md`:
   - **Light** — problem and solution shape are already clear (adding a
     `Behavior` following a pattern another `Behavior` already uses,
     adopting an established org-wide tooling convention, etc). Skip
     straight to step 4; most ADR sections compress to a sentence.
   - **Deep** — the problem is ambiguous, spans multiple subsystems, or has
     more than one plausible shape. Do step 3 first.
3. **Deep dive only: brainstorm before drafting anything.** Restate the
   problem in your own words. Surface the constraints that actually bind
   (existing `Behavior` composition model, no-Ruleset-reference rule,
   DI-only wiring, no migrations — pull the specifics from whichever
   conditional references you loaded above, don't restate them generically
   here). Generate **at least two genuinely different alternatives** — not
   a strawman and a preferred option; if you can only think of one real
   shape, it probably wasn't a deep dive. Research existing prior art if
   relevant (e.g. how WheelMUD solved the analogous problem — see
   `docs/research/wheelmud-findings.md` for the citation format) and record
   what's adopted vs. deliberately changed. **Talk it through with the
   user before committing to one** — if there's a genuine fork (e.g. "match
   an external reference's shape 1:1" vs. "a leaner reimplementation fit to
   this repo's actual needs"), surface it explicitly (a direct question
   works better than silently picking one and writing the ADR around it) —
   the point of this phase is to catch a disagreement before it's baked
   into an `Accepted` ADR, not after.
4. **Write the ADR.** Copy `docs/adr/0000-adr-template.md` to
   `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (next sequential number — check
   `docs/adr/README.md`'s index for the last one used). Fill in Context,
   Decision Drivers, Considered Options, Decision Outcome, Consequences,
   Links — compressed to a sentence/"N/A" per section for a light dive,
   full detail for a deep one. Keep it to decision content only — no task
   checklist, no file list (that's the plan, step 6). Set `Status:
   Proposed` while still unsettled; once the user has actually confirmed
   the direction (the deep dive's step 3 conversation, or an explicit "yes,
   do that" for a light one), flip it to `Accepted` — that status change
   *is* the record of the decision being made.
5. **Index and cross-link — without describing unimplemented behavior as
   current.** Add a row to `docs/adr/README.md`'s index table. Subsystem
   docs describe *current* state (`documentation.md`), and this task
   hasn't written any code yet, so don't rewrite a doc's prose to describe
   the new decision as already true. The only doc touch that belongs here
   is a forward-reference — an Open Items entry (or equivalent) noting the
   gap now has a decision, linked to the ADR, e.g. "resolved by ADR-NNNN,
   not yet implemented — see `tasks/implement.md`." Actually describing the
   new current state is `tasks/implement.md`'s step 6, once the code
   backing it exists. If this ADR supersedes an earlier one, set that
   ADR's `Status` to `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` — don't edit its Context/
   Decision/Options, an accepted ADR is a historical record.
6. **Decide whether a plan is warranted.** Per `docs/plans/README.md`: not
   every ADR needs one — a light dive whose outcome is an obvious one-file
   change doesn't. Write one when the implementation is multi-file, spans
   more than one sitting, or has enough real sequencing that a checklist
   earns its keep (this covers most deep dives and some light ones). If
   warranted: copy `docs/plans/0000-plan-template.md` to
   `docs/plans/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (same number as the ADR it
   implements), fill in Goal/Scope/Tasks/Critical files/Test plan/
   Verification, `Status: Not Started`. A plan can be drafted alongside a
   still-`Proposed` ADR (designing the how often surfaces questions about
   the what) — but it stays `Not Started` until the ADR is `Accepted`; a
   plan moving to `In Progress` against a `Proposed` ADR means code is
   being written for an unsettled decision.
7. **Index the plan** in `docs/plans/README.md` if one was created, and
   — if this design is a slice of the WheelMUD reconciliation roadmap —
   update `docs/plans/0001-wheelmud-reconciliation-roadmap.md`'s row for
   that slice to link the new ADR/plan.

## Output

An `Accepted` ADR (or a `Proposed` one, if genuinely still under
discussion and this task is being paused rather than finished), indexed,
cross-linked from the affected subsystem doc(s), with a `Plan` alongside
it if the implementation is non-trivial. That pair is the handoff to
`tasks/implement.md` — implementation shouldn't start (a plan shouldn't
move to `In Progress`) until the ADR reads `Accepted`.
